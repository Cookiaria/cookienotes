# cookienotes

stupid project ive started on an electron app that had access to dev tools and editing the html like that which later became this ; an actual website to host this thing because holy shit why do i not have access to notepad

im still mad about that. but if it weren't for that i wouldn't have started this and i am afraid there is no going back

### ⚠️ disclamer:

- this does not store anything anywhere except your pc with localstorage, if you clear site data and cookies, your saved notes will be gone ... if you're fast enough lol

- i cannot guarantee that it will actually save so dont get mad at me if it doesn't
